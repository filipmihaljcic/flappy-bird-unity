# Flappy Bird Unity

This is a recreation of classic Flappy Bird game launched in May 2013. Game is not made for relase; only made for learning purposes. Flappy Bird is 2D
side scroller where player has to navigate through set of pipes. After each set of pipes is passed one point is added to score etc etc. Game is very challenging to play and requires immense focus to be able to get high scores. No wonder why this game caused so much rage and frustration. Bellow is gameplay footage you are all familiar with.
